# Eaglercraft

Why is avacaine.githhub.io special?
For those who cannot enable JSPI (especially for people who may not have a ton of money, and cant afford a computer other than a free chromebook from a school)

You may want to play minecraft with optmial Java performance.
HOWEVER, many districts block chrome://flags

This developer JSPI launch from chrome dev - devloper.google.com has a JSPI origin request, automatically setting your browser to JSPI on that page.


-# Big thanks to everyone who forked and supported this repository, I apologize I didn't renew the origin trial, I have been busy, glad you were able to make use of it.
